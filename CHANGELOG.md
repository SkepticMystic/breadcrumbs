# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* Inline Dataview fields are now recognized inside blockquotes and callouts — `> up:: [[Note]]` (and `> - up:: [[Note]]`) now creates the `up` edge, matching the behavior already shipped on the 1.12 maintenance line (4.14.3, #724). A trailing link on the same line still stays ordinary prose, per the #731 fix.

### Build

* Retired `manifest-beta.json` and the separate `version-bump-beta.mjs` script. The 4.15.0 changelog noted BRAT reads `manifest-beta.json` from the repo root, which was true of older BRAT versions; as of BRAT v1.1.0 it's ignored entirely — beta installs are resolved by pinning a release tag and reading that release's `manifest.json` directly. `version:beta` now bumps `manifest.json` the same way `version:prod` does; the only thing that still needs to differ going into a beta release is `package.json`'s version carrying a `-beta.N` suffix.
* `release:beta` no longer pushes to a hardcoded branch — it pushes whatever branch is currently checked out. The hardcoded `main:main` was harmless on `main` but had been copied verbatim onto the `1.12-compat` branch as `master:master`, a branch that doesn't exist, silently breaking the script there.
* CI now runs on push to `main` and `1.12-compat`, not only on pull requests. A broken TypeScript pin sat on `main` for two months because nothing ever ran CI against the branch directly.
* `EdgeAttrFilters` no longer derives from the deprecated `BCEdgeAttributes`. It describes `implied_relations.transitive[].chain` — live settings data, not legacy — so it was mismarked, and defining it via a `Pick` of a deprecated type meant the directory scan flagged current config code as deprecated. The two fields are spelled out instead; the resulting type is identical (verified by type-level assertion). The deprecation on the migration-only `BreadcrumbsSettingsWithDirection` is accurate and stays.

## 4.X

### [4.21.3](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.21.2...4.21.3) (2026-07-25)

### Changed

* Two strings in the date-note setup modal now follow Obsidian's sentence-case convention: the heading reads "Set up date notes", and "etc." was reworded to "and so on". No other user-facing behaviour changes in this release.

### Build

* The community directory's plugin scan passes again. `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` added rules that forbid undescribed `eslint-disable` comments, require a matching `eslint-enable` for file-level ones, and ban suppressing certain rules inline at all — among them `no-explicit-any` and `no-deprecated`. Every remaining suppression now carries a `-- reason`. The ones that couldn't stay inline were either fixed properly or scoped in `eslint.config.mjs`, where an exemption is reviewable instead of scattered through the source.
* Removed the `any` behind three of those suppressions rather than silencing it. The codeblock field check compares against a widened `string[]`; the settings tab types its Svelte sub-pages as `Component<{ plugin }>` instead of `any`, which also cleared the unchecked `mount()` call; and the logger takes `unknown[]` rather than `any[]`.
* The generated WASM bindings no longer contain `any`. The `wasm:postbuild` step rewrites it to `unknown` — every call site already casts the result, so nothing downstream changes — which lets the suppression header drop `no-explicit-any` entirely and keeps `wasm/pkg` clean on regeneration.
* Codeblock options are built with Zod's `prefault` instead of `default`. `default` short-circuits parsing, so a fully absent options object would have yielded a bare `{}` with none of the per-field defaults applied. That path is unreachable today — the YAML is coalesced to `{}` before parsing — so there is no behaviour change, but the schema no longer needs an `as any` to typecheck and a test now pins the semantics.
* The `sentence-case` check is configured with `ISO` and `US` as known acronyms and day names as ignored words, so it stops rewriting correct copy while still catching real title-case slips.

### [4.21.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.21.1...4.21.2) (2026-07-25)

### Fixed

* Restored every missing margin, padding, gap, width and offset across the plugin. The stylesheet imported only Tailwind's utilities layer, but the numeric spacing scale that `p-2`, `gap-1`, `w-48`, `top-2` and friends resolve against lives in its theme layer — so all 39 of those classes, used in 15 files, were silently dropped at build time. Importing the theme layer brings them back. Expect slightly roomier spacing in the settings tab and the side views, and correctly positioned floating buttons in codeblocks. Preflight (Tailwind's browser reset) is deliberately still excluded, so nothing about Obsidian's own styling changes.
* The tree codeblock's copy button now floats in the top-right corner ([#736](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/736)) instead of rendering on top of the first row's collapse arrow. It was a casualty of the missing spacing scale above: the button was already positioned as floating, but its offsets compiled to nothing, so it fell back to the top-left of the tree.
* Codeblock buttons now sit in the same place in all three codeblock types. The mermaid and markmap copy buttons moved from the top-left to the top-right, matching the tree codeblock and Obsidian's own convention for code blocks. The markmap zoom/fit toolbar stays in the bottom-right.
* Links with a block or heading reference now point at the note itself ([#734](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/734)). `down:: [[2#^71f2d9]]` in `1.md` used to create an edge to a phantom `2#^71f2d9.md` node, so `1.md`'s tree looked right while `2.md` never showed `1.md` as its parent. The subpath is now stripped before resolving, for both frontmatter and inline fields and in list notes, and regardless of which folders the notes live in. A subpath-only link (`[[#^71f2d9]]`, pointing inside the same note) creates no edge.
* Inline Dataview fields no longer claim links that sit outside them ([#731](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/731)). `(down:: [[y]]) [[x]]` in `x.md` used to make **both** `[[y]]` and `[[x]]` `down` children — including a self-loop from the note to itself — because the builder attributed every link on a line to whichever field opened that line. Bracketed fields now end at their closing bracket, matching Dataview, so only `[[y]]` becomes an edge and links elsewhere on the line stay ordinary prose. Multiple fields on one line (`(up:: [[p]]) (down:: [[c]])`) are also parsed separately now. Bare line-level fields (`down:: [[y]], [[x]]`) are unchanged — their value is still the rest of the line.

### Security

* Pinned four transitive dependencies to clear high advisories flagged by `bun audit`: `linkify-it` (5.0.1 → 5.0.2), `postcss`, `brace-expansion` and `fast-uri`. Only `linkify-it` is on a runtime path — it ships inside `main.js` via markmap — but markmap builds its markdown parser with link auto-detection turned off, so the reported quadratic `mailto:` scan was never reachable. The other three are build-time only (eslint, vite, vitest). No runtime exposure in any case; the pins just move the lockfile out of the flagged ranges.

### Build

* TypeScript is pinned to 6.x. A dependency bump had moved it to 7, which removed the `baseUrl` compiler option and broke `svelte-check`, failing every CI run. `tsconfig.json` now uses the forward-compatible `paths` form, so the pin can be lifted once the Svelte and ESLint toolchains support TypeScript 7.

### [4.21.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.21.0...4.21.1) (2026-07-05)

### Features

* Markmap codeblocks now have a zoom/fit toolbar, matching the interactive controls markmap ships with elsewhere.

### Build

* Bumped JS dependencies (9 updates).

### [4.21.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.20.0...4.21.0) (2026-06-30)

### Features

* The edge audit report now has an **Ignore paths** setting (**Settings → Commands → Edge audit**). Notes inside a listed folder/path are left out of the whole report — orphans, dangling edges, and the field checks alike. Matching uses folder semantics (one path per line; a note matches if its path equals, or is inside, a listed path), so `Templates` covers everything under that folder. This is report-only: unlike the global **Excluded folders** setting, ignored notes still get their breadcrumb edges in the graph — they just don't clutter the audit.

### [4.20.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.19.4...4.20.0) (2026-06-29)

### Features

* Added a **Generate edge audit report** command. It walks the current graph and writes a read-only Markdown report to a configurable vault file (default `Breadcrumbs Edge Audit.md`; re-running overwrites it). The report surfaces **unused fields** (defined in settings but producing no edges), **implied-only fields** (only ever derived, never explicit), **mergeable fields** (whose explicit edges are strictly identical, so they're interchangeable), **orphan notes** (no breadcrumb edges in or out), and **dangling edges** (pointing at notes that don't exist). It only ever reports — it never rewrites your frontmatter. Configure the output path under **Settings → Commands → Edge audit**.

### [4.19.4](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.19.3...4.19.4) (2026-06-27)

### Security

* Pinned `undici` to `>=6.27.0` to clear an advisory flagged by the Obsidian community scanner. It was pulled in transitively (`markmap-lib` → `markmap-html-parser` → `cheerio` → `undici@6.26.0`) and is tree-shaken out of the shipped `main.js`, so there was no runtime exposure — but the lockfile reference still had to be moved out of the vulnerable range.

### [4.19.3](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.19.2...4.19.3) (2026-06-27)

### Changed

* The trail view's grid format now defaults its path selection to **`longest`**. Date notes (and any note with skip-level "shortcut" edges) link up to every ancestor level at once, so the old `all` default drew every redundant path and the grid read as a cluttered fan of repeated ancestors. `longest` keeps only the deepest chain — e.g. `2026 → 2026-Q2 → 2026-06 → 2026-W26` — so the trail reads as a clean tree. Existing trails keep their saved selection; switch via the trail's selection dropdown.

### [4.19.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.19.1...4.19.2) (2026-06-27)

### Changed

* Invalid edge-field errors from the explicit edge builders now consistently name the `BC-…-field` frontmatter key (e.g. `BC-tag-note-field`), and the Dataview builder's field validation matches the other builders. Internally, the seven builders that resolve a single edge field from frontmatter now share one `read_edge_field` helper, removing duplicated override → default → validate logic.
* The `typed_link` builder's inline-field parsing is now a pure, unit-tested `parse_inline_field` helper, and a redundant frontmatter/inline dedup layer was removed (the graph engine already deduplicates edges by resolved target and field). No behaviour change.
* The Tree, Matrix, and Trail views now share one `useViewSettings` helper for the local-settings-mirror + loop-safe writeback that each had duplicated. As part of this, the views no longer write their settings to disk on mount (only on an actual edit). The helper is unit-tested, including its loop-breaking semantics.
* Settings-panel callbacks now route their post-change side effects through one `commitSettings(policy)` helper (`"graph"` → rebuild + save, `"views"` → refresh + save, `"none"` → save) instead of ~140 callbacks each hand-pairing `saveSettings` with `rebuildGraph`/`refreshViews`. Behaviour-preserving — it consolidates the "which effect must follow this setting" rule into one place so panels can't drift.
* The WASM graph traversal is now reached through a small TS facade (`src/graph/traversal.ts`: `traverse` / `with_traversal` / `sort_traversal`) instead of every view and command hand-building the positional `TraversalOptions` + sorter and managing the result's lifecycle. `walk_to_roots` was likewise extracted from the tree view into `src/graph/`. Both are now unit-tested; no behaviour change.
* The free-on-change/unmount lifecycle for derived WASM objects (the node-rendering options and the tree-view traversal result) is now owned by one `useOwned` rune helper instead of an identical `$effect` cleanup hand-copied across 8 view components. Unit-tested; no behaviour change.

### Fixed

* **The tree view's "Merge fields" toggle was inverted** — it separated fields when set to merge and vice versa. It now matches its label (and the trail view / codeblock behaviour). Surfaced while routing the view through the new traversal facade.
* **Renaming or deleting an edge field now updates the Dataview builder's default field.** Previously the rename/delete cascade skipped the Dataview source's `default field`, so it kept pointing at the old (now invalid) field name until you fixed it by hand.

## 4.X

### [4.19.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.19.0...4.19.1) (2026-06-18)

### Features

* **Export to canvas** — a new command that lays out a note's neighbourhood as a native JSON Canvas (`.canvas`). Pick which edge field-groups to follow and the depth, choose left-to-right or top-to-bottom layout, and the canvas is built as a tidy tree with each parent centred over its children. Defaults are configurable under Settings → Commands → Create canvas; re-exporting an existing canvas prompts to overwrite or create a new one.
* **Jump to neighbour (picker)** — a fuzzy-suggest command listing all of the active note's neighbours (grouped by field) to jump to, complementing the existing "jump to first neighbour" commands.
* **Per-field jump commands** — "Jump to first neighbour by field:`<field>`" is now registered for every edge field, so directions like `up`/`down`/`next`/`prev` can each be bound to their own hotkey.

### Fixed

* Johnny.Decimal **sibling edges now work at the category level** (e.g. `11`↔`12` under area `10`), not just for delimited items (`11.01`↔`11.02`). The sibling grouping now shares the same parent resolution as the up-edge builder.

### [4.19.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.18.1...4.19.0) (2026-06-17)

### Removed

* Removed the **`type: graph`** codeblock and its **`exclude-folders`** option (both added in 4.18.0). A whole-vault graph quickly exceeds Mermaid's edge limit and freezes large vaults, so the feature needs a rethink before it returns. Existing `type: graph` blocks now report an invalid type — switch to `tree`, `mermaid`, or `markmap`.

### Changed

* Codeblock `from:` **folder queries now match case-insensitively** (e.g. `from: '"projects"'` matches a `Projects/` folder), mirroring Dataview.
* `type: markmap` with `from:` now **keeps the map within the matched notes** instead of following edges out into the rest of the vault.
* A `breadcrumbs` codeblock with no `depth:` now **defaults to depth `[0, 5]`** instead of unbounded, so traversals on large vaults no longer hang.

### Performance

* Codeblock tree traversal no longer clones its ancestor set at every node (O(n²) → O(n) allocations), speeding up deep or wide trees.

### [4.18.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.18.0...4.18.1) (2026-06-17)

### Security

* Pinned the transitive `vite` dev-dependency to **8.0.16**, clearing two advisories (GHSA-v6wh-96g9-6wx3, GHSA-fx2h-pf6j-xcff) that affected `8.0.0`–`8.0.15`. Both are Windows dev-server issues; `vite` is only used to run the test suite and is never part of the shipped plugin, so end users were never exposed.

### Build

* Bumped JavaScript dev-dependencies (eslint, esbuild, vitest, tailwindcss, typescript-eslint and others) and the Rust/WASM crates (`itertools` 0.15, `smallvec`, `hashbrown`), and regenerated the committed `wasm/pkg/` bindings. No functional change.

### [4.18.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.17.0...4.18.0) (2026-06-16)

### Features

* New codeblock **`type: graph`** — renders the whole vault (or a `from:`-scoped subset) as one Mermaid graph, instead of traversing out from a single note. Useful for an overview MOC or seeing a folder/tag's structure at a glance.
* `type: graph` codeblocks accept an **`exclude-folders`** list to drop folders from the graph. It's additive to the global Excluded folders setting, so you can hide extra folders per-codeblock without changing your vault-wide config.
* **Dataview Notes** now have a settings page with a configurable default field, used when a note sets `BC-dataview-note-query` without `BC-dataview-note-field`.

### Changed

* The codeblock `dataview-from` field is renamed to **`from`**. The name is now misleading — the Dataview dependency was removed, and Breadcrumbs parses the `#tag` / `"folder"` / `[[link]]` query itself. The old `dataview-from` still works as a deprecated alias and logs a console warning.
* The Edge fields **Hide in views** toggle is renamed **Hide in side views** to reflect that it only affects the Matrix and Tree side panels.
* The **Self is sibling** control moved from the Edge fields page to the Implied relations page, where it belongs.

### Removed

* The unused `traverse_note` default-field setting (it could never be applied safely) and the dead `content` / `field-prefix` codeblock fields.

### Fixed

* Renaming or removing an edge field now updates *every* place that referenced it — including sibling-field defaults (tag/dendron/Johnny.Decimal) and date-note period fields — so no setting can be left pointing at a renamed or deleted field.

### [4.17.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.16.1...4.17.0) (2026-06-14)

### Features

* New per-edge-field **Hide in views** toggle (Settings → Edge fields). A field marked hidden stays in its groups, codeblocks, and the graph, but is no longer rendered in the Matrix and Tree side views — handy for structural fields you don't want cluttering the panels ([#132](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/discussions/132)).

### Fixed

* Removing an edge field now also drops any transitive implied-relation rules that referenced it and clears edge-source default-field settings that pointed at it. Previously those references dangled, and a stale reverse-edge rule could surface a phantom field in the views.

### [4.16.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.16.0...4.16.1) (2026-06-13)

### Build

- Code-quality cleanup, no functional change: removed redundant non-null assertions in the list-note section resolver, switched an array type to `T[]` syntax, and capitalized a settings placeholder to satisfy the Obsidian UI lint rule. `src/` now passes ESLint with no `@typescript-eslint` warnings.

### [4.16.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.15.2...4.16.0) (2026-06-13)

### Features

* List Notes can be scoped to a single heading with `BC-list-note-section: "<heading>"` in frontmatter. Only list items under that heading become edges; the section runs to the next equal-or-higher-level heading (or end of file), so nested sub-headings stay inside it. Without the field, the whole note is read as before ([#363](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/discussions/363)).
* New **Excluded folders** setting — notes inside the listed folders are skipped when generating edges (one folder path per line). A note is excluded if its path equals, or is inside, a listed folder ([#358](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/discussions/358)).
* List Notes can exempt individual links with a `BC-list-note-exclude` frontmatter list of wikilinks. Any listed link stays in the note's list but does not become a child edge — useful for reference/see-also links ([#365](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/discussions/365)).

### [4.15.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.15.1...4.15.2) (2026-06-11)

### Fixed

* Settings sub-pages (Edge fields, Tag notes, and every other section) rendered blank — title only, no controls — on Obsidian 1.13.1. Each sub-page now renders through the documented `SettingPage` page factory instead of the previous workaround ([#713](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/713)).

### [4.15.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.15.0...4.15.1) (2026-06-09)

### Fixed

* Detect Dataview inline fields wrapped in parentheses or brackets — `(down:: [[Note]])` and `[down:: [[Note]]]` now build edges, matching how Dataview itself parses these forms ([#710](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/710)).

### Build

- Bump JS dev dependencies (svelte-check 4.6, svelte 5.56.3, typescript-eslint 8.60.1, @types/node 25.9.2).
- Add `svelte.config.mjs` so `svelte-check` 4.6 reads the Svelte config directly instead of probing `vite.config.mjs` (which has no `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte`, since this project builds via `esbuild-svelte`).

### [4.15.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.14.2...4.15.0) (2026-06-07)

**Breaking:** Breadcrumbs now requires Obsidian 1.13.0 or later. If you're still on Obsidian 1.12, stay on 4.14.2 — the 1.12 line is maintained on the `1.12-compat` branch.

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Require Obsidian 1.13.0. The imperative `display()` settings fallback for older app versions has been removed; the settings tab now renders entirely through the declarative `getSettingDefinitions()` API, so every section appears in global settings search and supports page-based navigation.

### Features

* Settings tab now shows a "waypoints" icon next to its name in the settings list and global search.
* Reordered settings sections — Views lead with Page (the in-note views) before the sidebar views; Edge sources are grouped as content-based (tag, list), then filename-derived (dendron, johnny.decimal, date, regex), then query-based (traverse).
* Added a short description under every settings entry so each section's purpose is clear at a glance.

### Documentation

* Expanded the Security & Privacy section: documented the bundled-dependency `fetch()` matches (KaTeX lexer method, markmap's CDN asset loader), the exported WASM linear memory, and the single wasm-bindgen `new Function()` (no `eval`).

### Build

* Stopped attaching `manifest-beta.json` to GitHub releases — Obsidian only downloads `main.js`/`manifest.json`/`styles.css`, and BRAT reads `manifest-beta.json` from the repo root.

### [4.14.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.14.1...4.14.2) (2026-06-05)

Internal maintenance release — no user-facing behavior changes.

### Performance

* Debounce side/page view setting writes (Tree View, Matrix, Trail View) so rapid control changes coalesce into a single save instead of hitting disk on every change.
* Index date-note period lookups with a basename map, replacing nested linear scans (O(n·m) → O(n)) during graph rebuilds.
* Debounce the opt-in "rebuild graph on layout change" trigger so it no longer rebuilds on every editor cursor move or scroll.

### Refactors

* Extract a shared `validate_edge_field` helper used across all explicit edge builders.
* Replace untyped `any` casts on Obsidian/Dataview internals with typed shapes.
* Remove dead code, including the unused Dataview file-source path. No effect on the `dataview-from` codeblock feature.

### Tests

* Add unit tests for the date, list, folder, dataview, and traverse note builders.

### Chores

* Address Obsidian community plugin scorecard lint findings, including scoping the lint-suppression header in the generated WASM type declarations.
* Update funding links (GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee).

### [4.14.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.14.0...4.14.1) (2026-06-03)

### Bug Fixes

* **Tree View multi-parent** — a note with multiple parents now appears under each parent in the Tree View. Previously, a shared `visited` set across all traversal branches caused the node to appear only once (under whichever parent was processed first). Replaced with a per-branch `ancestors` set so cycle detection blocks only literal ancestors on the current path, not siblings or diamond nodes.

### [4.14.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.11...4.14.0) (2026-06-02)

### Features

* **`self_is_sibling` implied relation** — new setting in Edge Fields → Self group. Fields listed there automatically generate an implied self-loop edge for every note that participates in an edge of that type (either as source or target). Defaults to `["same"]`, restoring the classic Breadcrumbs behaviour where a note appears in its own sibling list. Configurable via the tag-chip selector in the Edge Fields settings page.

### Bug Fixes

* **`folder_note` builder** — `BC-folder-note-field` now creates edges to `.canvas` and `.base` files, not just `.md` files. Extension filter now matches the same set used when collecting vault nodes.
* **`list_note` builder** — no longer requires Dataview. Rebuilt using Obsidian's native `metadataCache.listItems` + `metadataCache.links` + `vault.cachedRead`; field overrides and neighbour-field edges preserved.
* **`typed_link` builder** — added a native second pass for body inline fields (`field:: [[value]]` syntax). Previously required Dataview; now resolved from `cache.links` + line content, covering self-references and inline-only fields.
* **`dataview-from:` codeblock option** — no longer requires Dataview. Replaced with a native FROM-clause parser supporting `#tag`, `"folder"`, `[[link]]`, and `AND`/`OR`/`NOT` combinations (`src/codeblocks/dataview_from.ts`).
* **Markmap codeblock** — live re-query on each update now uses the native FROM parser instead of calling the Dataview API directly; restores markmap rendering when Dataview is not installed.

### Chores

* **Removed `obsidian-dataview` dev dependency** — plugin no longer imports from the `obsidian-dataview` package. Dataview API is accessed at runtime via `app.plugins.plugins["dataview"]?.api` (optional; `dataview_note` builder still uses it when installed). Eliminates all npm audit findings (was 12 vulns via transitive svelte 3.x in `obsidian-calendar-ui`).

### [4.13.11](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.10...4.13.11) (2026-06-02)

### Chores

* **Dependency updates** — bumped `@types/obsidian-typings` alias from `obsidian-typings@^3.16.6` to `^6.13.0`, matching the runtime dep. Added `package-lock.json` for npm audit compatibility. Reduced npm audit findings from 12 to 3 (remaining 3 are SSR-only Svelte vulns inside `obsidian-calendar-ui`, unfixable without an upstream `obsidian-dataview` fix).

### [4.13.10](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.9...4.13.10) (2026-06-02)

### Bug Fixes

* **`folder_note` builder** — `BC-folder-note-field` now creates edges to `.canvas` and `.base` files inside a folder, not just `.md` files. The extension filter is now driven by the same `NON_MD_EXTENSIONS` set used when collecting vault files for the graph.

### [4.13.9](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.8...4.13.9) (2026-06-02)

### Chores

* **Dependency updates** — bumped all outdated dev dependencies: `npm-run-all2` 7 → 9, `prettier-plugin-svelte` 3 → 4, `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` 0.6 → 0.8, `obsidian-typings` 3 → 6, plus minor/patch bumps for `vitest`, `svelte-check`, and `svelte-preprocess`.

### Tests

* **`typed_link` builder** — added 18 test cases covering the Obsidian `frontmatterLinks` branch (unresolved links, resolved links, list-type keys, multiple edges) and the Dataview branch (Link objects, markdown link strings, invalid values, dedup logic). Extended test helpers with `frontmatterLinks` support in `mock_file` and `resolve_link`/`fileManager` in `make_plugin`.

### [4.13.8](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.7...4.13.8) (2026-06-01)

### Features

* **Date Notes quick setup** — a "Set up…" button at the top of the Date Notes settings section opens a modal for one-click hierarchy configuration. Choose which period levels to enable (week / month / quarter / year), opt in to period-specific edge fields (`next_week` / `prev_week`, `next_month` / `prev_month`, etc. — created automatically and added to the `nexts` / `prevs` field groups), and pick the week start day. On confirm, the modal enables the selected periods, bumps the `up` / `down` transitive-rule rounds to 3 for full daily → week → month → quarter → year chaining, and adds `next ↔ prev` reversal rules for each period-specific field. Modal choices are remembered across opens.
* **`week_start` setting** — new "Week starts on" option (Monday / Sunday) in Date Notes settings and in the quick-setup modal. When set to Sunday, daily notes that fall on a Sunday are shifted forward one day before the ISO week lookup, so they map to the _following_ week's note — matching US-style week file numbering. Available in both the quick-setup modal and the main Date Notes settings panel.

### [4.13.7](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.6...4.13.7) (2026-05-31)

### Chores

* **ESLint** — integrated `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` recommended config. Fixed plugin registration conflict (`@typescript-eslint` was being registered twice — once by obsidianmd's config and once by our own); now both `import` and `@typescript-eslint` plugins are stripped from obsidianmd's spread before our own registrations. Resolved all resulting warnings: `Array<T>` → `T[]` in `traverse_note.ts`, removed unused `Result` import in `result.ts`, dropped unnecessary `as any` cast in `SettingsTab`, and suppressed `no-deprecated` on the intentional `this.display()` fallback call that supports Obsidian < 1.13.

### [4.13.6](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.5...4.13.6) (2026-05-31)

### Bug Fixes

* **Pretty Properties cover image click conflict** — the `.BC-page-views` container now sets `pointer-events: none` on itself and restores `pointer-events: auto` on its children, so the empty wrapper never intercepts clicks on underlying plugin elements (e.g. the Pretty Properties cover image). When both Trail and Prev/Next views are disabled, the container is no longer inserted into the DOM at all. TrailView also no longer renders a bare `<div>` wrapper when it has no paths to display, eliminating invisible empty nodes that could contribute to the interference (closes [#704](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/704)).

### [4.13.5](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.4...4.13.5) (2026-05-31)

### Bug Fixes

* **`link_kind: "markdown"` path format** — list-index and codeblock outputs now use `app.fileManager.generateMarkdownLink`, so vault link-format settings (shortest path / relative / absolute) are respected. Unresolved ghost-node paths fall back to the previous manual form.
* **`deep_merge_objects` null fields** — settings keys stored as `null` (e.g. from older vault data) now correctly fall back to their defaults instead of being silently retained as `null`, which could previously cause a `TypeError` when the value was expected to be an object.
* **Dataview-inline drop-crumb deduplication** — running "Drop crumbs" more than once no longer appends duplicate `field::` lines. Existing inline fields are found by regex, merged, and deduped in-place; only genuinely new fields are appended.

### Improvements

* **Codeblock empty state** — when a `breadcrumbs` codeblock finds no paths, the empty-state message now names the fields that were searched (e.g. "No paths found for field(s): up, down"), making misconfigured field names easier to spot.
* **"Create list index" command** — the command is now hidden from the command palette when no file is active, instead of opening a modal that immediately closes with a notice.
* **TrailView controls** — removed redundant `onchange` save calls from the format/selection dropdowns; the existing `$effect` writeback already persists every settings change.

### [4.13.4](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.3...4.13.4) (2026-05-31)

### Bug Fixes

* **Graph rebuild on note save** — replaced the blanket 10 s debounce with a `_pending_rebuild` flag that fires `rebuildGraph` only after `metadataCache:resolved`, so the graph updates promptly when the cache finishes processing a save rather than waiting an arbitrary delay.

### Build

* **ES2022 targets** — TypeScript `target` and esbuild `target` both updated from ES6/ES2020 to ES2022, matching the minimum Electron version Obsidian ships.
* **tsconfig aligned with Obsidian Svelte docs** — added `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `skipLibCheck`, and `**/*.svelte` to `include`; trimmed redundant `lib` entries (ES5/ES6/ES7) superseded by ES2022; added `--tsconfig` flag to `svelte-check` script.

### [4.13.3](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.2...4.13.3) (2026-05-31)

### Bug Fixes

* **`type: markmap` — dark mode text** — markmap node labels now use `var(--text-normal)` so they are readable in both light and dark Obsidian themes.

### [4.13.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.1...4.13.2) (2026-05-30)

### Features

* **`type: markmap` — native interactive SVG rendering** — markmap graphs are now rendered directly via the bundled `markmap-lib` + `markmap-view` libraries. No external plugin (markmap-obsidian) required. The SVG supports zoom, pan, and node collapse out of the box. Clicking any node text navigates to the corresponding note; Ctrl/Cmd+click opens in a new pane.

### Bug Fixes

* **`type: markmap` — wikilink display** — `[[path|alias]]` wikilinks in node labels are now stripped to clean display names (alias or basename) before rendering.
* **`type: markmap` — WASM revision mismatch** — fixed an illegal `$state` mutation inside `$derived.by()` that caused `"Edge was created in revision N, but current revision is N+1"` errors on graph updates. Now uses a single pure derivation. Old `FlatTraversalResult` is freed after state is updated so reactive reads always see valid WASM memory.

### [4.13.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.0...4.13.1) (2026-05-30)

### Bug Fixes

* **`type: markmap` with `dataview-from`** — the markmap now uses the Dataview query results as traversal entry nodes instead of the codeblock's own note, and suppresses the spurious `# [[current-note]]` root heading. The Dataview query is re-evaluated on every update so it is never stale from plugin load time. Fixes notes where the codeblock has no direct edges into the queried scope.
* **`type: markmap` render error** — `CodeblockMDRC` (a `MarkdownRenderChild`) is now threaded as the parent component to `MarkdownRenderer.render()`. This gives the markmap-obsidian codeblock processor the MarkdownView context it needs, fixing `"Couldn't find MarkdownView containing code block"` (issue [#703](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/issues/703)).

### [4.13.0](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.12.3...4.13.0) (2026-05-30)

### Features

* **Obsidian 1.13 declarative settings** — `BreadcrumbsSettingTab` now implements `getSettingDefinitions()`, enabling page-based navigation, global settings search, and proper `hide()` lifecycle. All sections (Edge fields, Implied relations, Edge sources, Views, Commands, Suggestors, Debug) are navigable pages. The existing `display()` is retained as a fallback for Obsidian < 1.13. Settings search navigation uses an `items`-based sentinel row pattern — the `page` factory approach silently skipped `display()` on search navigation in Obsidian 1.13.
* **Traverse note builder** — a new explicit edge source. Annotate any note with `BC-traverse-note-field: <field>` to make it a traversal root. Breadcrumbs performs a DFS walk of the Obsidian vault link graph starting from that note, generating one edge per parent→child hop.
* **Compact edge fields UI** — groups row merged inline with the field row; the "Add to Group" dropdown replaced with a `+` button that opens an Obsidian context menu listing available groups. Spacing tightened to an `<hr>` separator between items. Move-up/move-down arrow buttons added for keyboard-accessible reordering.

### Bug Fixes

* **Settings search navigation** — sub-pages now load correctly when reached via Obsidian 1.13's global settings search.
* **`Plugin.settings` accessor conflict** — Obsidian 1.13.0 introduced `settings?: unknown` on the base `Plugin` class. `BreadcrumbsPlugin` replaced the `get`/`set` accessor with `declare settings: BreadcrumbsSettings`.

### Chores

* **Upgrade obsidian dev dependency to 1.13.0** — picks up `SettingPage`, `SettingDefinitionItem`, and related declarative-settings types.
* **Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger** to release workflow.
* **Correct maintainer takeover date** in README to May 2026.

### [4.13.0-beta.4](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.0-beta.3...4.13.0-beta.4) (2026-05-30)

### Bug Fixes

* **Settings search navigation** — sub-pages (Edge fields, Transitive, all edge sources, views, commands, suggestors) now load correctly when reached via Obsidian 1.13's global settings search. Root cause: Obsidian skips `display()` on `SettingPage` subclasses returned from a `page` factory when navigating from search results. All page definitions now use `items` with a sentinel `render` row (matching the pattern used by notebook-navigator) so search navigation and direct navigation both work.

### [4.13.0-beta.3](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.0-beta.2...4.13.0-beta.3) (2026-05-29)

### Features

* **Traverse note builder** — a new explicit edge source. Annotate any note with `BC-traverse-note-field: <field>` to make it a traversal root. Breadcrumbs performs a DFS walk of the Obsidian vault link graph (resolved wikilinks) starting from that note, generating one edge per parent→child hop in the traversal tree. No special frontmatter required on linked notes.

### [4.13.0-beta.2](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.13.0-beta.1...4.13.0-beta.2) (2026-05-29)

### Features

* **Compact edge fields UI** — groups row merged inline with the field row; the "Add to Group" dropdown replaced with a `+` button that opens an Obsidian context menu listing available groups. Spacing tightened to an `<hr>` separator between items. Move-up/move-down arrow buttons added for keyboard-accessible reordering (splice-based, correct when the name filter is active).

### [4.13.0-beta.1](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.12.3...4.13.0-beta.1) (2026-05-29)

### Features

* **Obsidian 1.13 declarative settings** — `BreadcrumbsSettingTab` now implements `getSettingDefinitions()`, enabling page-based navigation, global settings search, and proper `hide()` lifecycle on Obsidian 1.12.3+. All sections (Edge fields, Implied relations, Edge sources, Views, Commands, Suggestors, Debug) are surfaced as navigable pages. The existing imperative `display()` is retained as a fallback for Obsidian versions below 1.13.0.

### Chores

* **Upgrade obsidian dev dependency to 1.13.0** — picks up new `SettingPage`, `SettingDefinitionItem`, and related declarative-settings types.
* **Fix `Plugin.settings` accessor conflict** — Obsidian 1.13.0 introduces `settings?: unknown` on the base `Plugin` class. `BreadcrumbsPlugin` replaced the `get`/`set` accessor with `declare settings: BreadcrumbsSettings`; `loadSettings()` now calls `reactive_settings.init()` explicitly to keep the Svelte 5 reactive store in sync.
* **Update author in `package.json`** to `michaelpporter`.

### CI

* **Add `workflow_dispatch` trigger** to release workflow.

### Documentation

* **Correct maintainer takeover date** in README to May 2026.

### [4.12.3](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs/compare/4.12.2...4.12.3) (2026-05-28)

### Chores

* **Update GitHub repository references** — all in-repo links (manifests, CONTRIBUTING, SettingsTab, AGENTS) now point to the new location at `michaelpporter/breadcrumbs` following the project transfer.

### [4.12.2](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.12.1...4.12.2) (2026-05-27)

### Bug Fixes

* **Johnny.Decimal area→category edges now resolve** — categories like `11 Finance` were not linked to their area `10 Life Admin` because the builder only used delimiter-splitting to find parents. Splitting `"11"` by `"."` yields no parent. Area parents are now derived numerically (`floor(n/10)*10`), so `11 → 10`, `21 → 20`, etc. Area notes (exact multiples of 10) remain top-level with no parent.

### Build

* **Expose `GCEdgeData` field accessors in WASM bindings** — `source`, `target`, `edge_type`, and `edge_source` are now exposed as `#[wasm_bindgen(getter)]` properties, enabling type-safe access in TypeScript tests without casting.
* **Fix TypeScript build errors in test suite** — `succ`/`fail` now return concrete types so `.data`/`.error` are accessible without discriminant narrowing; builder tests updated to `async`/`await` to satisfy the `MaybePromise<EdgeBuilderResults>` return type.

### [4.12.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.12.0...4.12.1) (2026-05-26)

### Bug Fixes

* **Free WASM objects to prevent long-session memory leaks** — all components that create `NodeStringifyOptions`, `FlatTraversalResult`, `TraversalResult`, `PathList`, `Path[]`, and `MermaidGraphData` now explicitly free them via `$effect` cleanup and `onDestroy`. Addresses a reported 16 GB memory growth over long sessions ([#698](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/698)).
* **Johnny.Decimal notes no longer link to ghost parent nodes** — the Dendron builder was splitting any dot-containing basename (e.g. `12.01 GP Records`) and creating phantom nodes like `12.md`. Files whose first dot-segment is all digits are now skipped — they belong to the Johnny.Decimal builder.

### CI

* **Remove Rust/WASM toolchain from release workflow** — `wasm/pkg/` is committed to the repo; release builds only need Bun. Drops Rust install, wasm-pack install, `wasm:test`, and `wasm:build` from the release job, significantly reducing release CI time.

### [4.12.0](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.10...4.12.0) (2026-05-26)

### Chores

* **Add `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd`** — integrates Obsidian's official ESLint plugin (v0.3.0) into the lint pipeline. Enforces plugin guidelines on command IDs, settings headings, UI sentence case, vault APIs, and more. ESLint now errors at max 0 warnings.
* **Strip plugin-ID prefix from all command IDs** — command IDs previously included the `breadcrumbs:` prefix (e.g. `breadcrumbs:rebuild-graph`), causing Obsidian to register them as `breadcrumbs:breadcrumbs:rebuild-graph`. All IDs are now unprefixed per Obsidian guidelines. **⚠ Breaking for users with custom keybindings** — re-bind any affected commands after updating.
* **Remove `confirm()` from freeze-to-vault command** — replaced the browser `confirm()` dialog with the existing `GenericModal` prompt (which already requires typing `FREEZE TO VAULT` to confirm). `confirm()` is not permitted in Obsidian plugins.
* **Sentence case audit** — fix casing in several UI strings: `'Show/Copy graph stats'` → `'Show/copy graph stats'`, `'Create List Index'` → `'Create list index'`, `'Build & Copy to Clipboard'` → `'Build & copy to clipboard'`, `'Enable Previous/Next view'` / `'Previous/Next'` → lowercase, `'No active markdown view'` → `'No active Markdown view'`.
* **Zod `.passthrough()` → `.loose()`** — `.passthrough()` is deprecated in Zod v4; updated codeblock schema to use `.loose()`.
* **AGENTS.md** — replace generic sample-plugin template with breadcrumbs-specific guidance covering bun, Svelte 5 runes, WASM boundary, edge builders, settings migration, and agent do/don't rules.

### [4.11.10](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.9...4.11.10) (2026-05-25)

### Bug Fixes

* **Trail view not updating on note switch** — the `layout-change` early-return optimisation (introduced in 4.11.7 for [#698](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/698)) skipped remounting when editor mode and sticky setting were unchanged, but did not check which file was open. Switching notes in the same tab left the Trail/Prev-Next page view showing the previous note's breadcrumbs. `file_path` is now included in the skip condition; CM6 cursor/scroll events still short-circuit as before ([#700](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/700)).

### Build

* **Commit wasm/pkg artifacts; drop `wasm:build` from CI** — `wasm/pkg` was re-gitignored in 4.11.9-beta.1, breaking the Obsidian community build verifier (clean env, no Rust toolchain). Pre-built WASM binaries are committed again; CI and Makefile no longer run `wasm:build` (`wasm:test` still runs to verify Rust logic). To update the WASM binary: run `bun run wasm:build` locally and commit the result.

### Chores

* **Plugin guideline compliance** — replace `innerHTML` with `createEl()`/`appendText()` in date-note settings descriptions; remove leftover debug `console.log` calls from `FieldFuzzySuggestModal`.
* **CLAUDE.md** — note git-ignored files so Claude Code avoids reading generated artifacts.

### [4.11.9](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.8...4.11.9) (2026-05-24)

### Build

* **Restore wasm:build in CI** — revert the 4.11.8 approach of committing `wasm/pkg` artifacts; build WASM from source in CI again. `wasm/pkg/` is back to gitignored; reproducibility ensured by the pinned `wasm-bindgen-cli 0.2.100`.
* **Remove ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD** — no longer needed with `--frozen-lockfile`.
* **Fix TS 6 module augmentation** — `obsidian-typings` 3.16 moved its augmentations into `.d.cts` files; TypeScript 6 does not apply module augmentations from `.d.cts` type-reference entries. Added `src/obsidian-unofficial.d.ts` with local `declare module "obsidian"` augmentations for `metadataTypeManager`, `MetadataCache.initialized`, and `MetadataCache.on("initialized")`.
* **Pin svelte-preprocess to 6.0.3** — 6.0.4 introduced a broken ESM import (missing `.js` extension on transformer sub-paths).
* **Add ES2022 to tsconfig lib** — `Array.at()` requires `es2022`; previous lib target caused CI type errors.

### Chores

* **Dependency updates** — `obsidian` → 1.12.3, `obsidian-typings` → 3.16.6, `svelte` → 5.55.9, `tailwindcss`/`@tailwindcss/cli` → 4.3.0, `zod` → 4.4.3, `vitest` → 4.1.7, `eslint` → 10.4.0, plus minor bumps to `luxon`, `lucide-svelte`, `caniuse-lite`, `baseline-browser-mapping`, and several ESLint/Svelte/TypeScript tooling packages.

### [4.11.9-beta.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.8...4.11.9-beta.1) (2026-05-24)

### Build

* **Restore wasm:build in CI** — revert the 4.11.8 approach of committing `wasm/pkg` artifacts; build WASM from source in CI again. `wasm/pkg/` is back to gitignored; reproducibility ensured by the pinned `wasm-bindgen-cli 0.2.100`.
* **Remove ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD** — no longer needed with `--frozen-lockfile`.
* **Fix TS 6 module augmentation** — `obsidian-typings` 3.16 moved its augmentations into `.d.cts` files; TypeScript 6 does not apply module augmentations from `.d.cts` type-reference entries. Added `src/obsidian-unofficial.d.ts` with local `declare module "obsidian"` augmentations for `metadataTypeManager`, `MetadataCache.initialized`, and `MetadataCache.on("initialized")`.
* **Pin svelte-preprocess to 6.0.3** — 6.0.4 introduced a broken ESM import (missing `.js` extension on transformer sub-paths).

### Chores

* **Dependency updates** — `obsidian` → 1.12.3, `obsidian-typings` → 3.16.6, `svelte` → 5.55.9, `tailwindcss`/`@tailwindcss/cli` → 4.3.0, `zod` → 4.4.3, `vitest` → 4.1.7, `eslint` → 10.4.0, plus minor bumps to `luxon`, `lucide-svelte`, `caniuse-lite`, `baseline-browser-mapping`, and several ESLint/Svelte/TypeScript tooling packages.

### [4.11.8](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.7...4.11.8) (2026-05-24)

### Build

* **Reproducible release builds** — restore committed `wasm/pkg` artifacts so CI and Obsidian's build verifier use the same WASM binary; remove `wasm:build` from the release workflow; pin bun to 1.3.14; use `--frozen-lockfile`. Fixes "main.js built from source does not match the release artifact".
* **Skip electron binary download in CI** — set `ELECTRON_SKIP_BINARY_DOWNLOAD=1` to prevent electron's postinstall from fetching binaries (Obsidian provides electron at runtime; we never need it installed).

### [4.11.7](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.6...4.11.7) (2026-05-24)

### Bug Fixes

* **Cursor/scroll lag in source mode** — `layout-change` fires on every CM6 cursor movement and scroll tick, causing a full Svelte unmount+remount of the Trail/Prev-Next page view on each tick even when nothing had changed. The DOM thrash inside `.cm-scroller` made CM6 re-measure and skip cursor positions (visible as paragraph jumps in vim mode). Page views are now only remounted when the editor mode (source vs. preview) or the sticky setting actually changes; repeat `layout-change` firings with an already-correct mount are ignored ([#698](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/698)).

### Build

* **Clean step** — `bun run build` now removes stale `main.js` and `styles.css` before rebuilding, preventing Obsidian from loading leftover artifacts.
* **Tailwind CLI resolution** — scripts now use `bunx tailwindcss` so the build works in clean environments where `tailwindcss` is not on `PATH`.

### [4.11.7-beta.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.6...4.11.7-beta.1) (2026-05-23)

### Bug Fixes

* **Cursor/scroll lag in source mode** — `layout-change` fires on every CM6 cursor movement and scroll tick, causing a full Svelte unmount+remount of the Trail/Prev-Next page view on each tick even when nothing had changed. The DOM thrash inside `.cm-scroller` made CM6 re-measure and skip cursor positions (visible as paragraph jumps in vim mode). Page views are now only remounted when the editor mode (source vs. preview) or the sticky setting actually changes; repeat `layout-change` firings with an already-correct mount are ignored ([#698](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/698)).

### [4.11.6](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.5...4.11.6) (2026-05-22)

### Bug Fixes

* **Community build verification** — commit `wasm/pkg/` (generated WASM bindings) so the Obsidian community plugin build checker can run `bun run build` without a Rust/wasm-pack toolchain. `wasm-pack` auto-generates a `pkg/.gitignore` with `*` that previously excluded the entire directory; that file is now overridden so the JS bindings and type declarations are tracked in git.

### [4.11.5](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.4...4.11.5) (2026-05-22)

### Bug Fixes

* **Scroll performance degradation** — Obsidian's `layout-change` event fires on every scroll tick in newer versions, triggering a full unmount+remount of the page-view (Trail/Prev-Next) Svelte component on each tick. Added a 150 ms leading-edge debounce to the `layout-change` → redraw-page-views path so rapid bursts coalesce into a single redraw. Graph-update-triggered redraws remain immediate ([#698](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/698)).

### [4.11.4](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.3...4.11.4) (2026-05-21)

### Bug Fixes

* **Release validation** — remove `breadcrumbs_graph_wasm_bg.wasm` from GitHub release assets. Obsidian's community plugin validator only permits `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`; the extra WASM asset caused build verification to fail.

### [4.11.3](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.2...4.11.3) (2026-05-20)

### Chores

* **CI: add WASM asset and build attestations to releases** — `breadcrumbs_graph_wasm_bg.wasm` is now included as a GitHub release asset (resolves Obsidian scorecard warning "Plugin references 1 unrecognized .wasm file(s)"). Build provenance attestations are generated for `main.js`, `styles.css`, and the WASM file via `actions/attest-build-provenance`. Committed `wasm/Cargo.lock` for reproducible WASM builds.

### [4.11.2](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.1...4.11.2) (2026-05-20)

### Bug Fixes

* **Thread by command crashed without injecting edge** — `vault.create()` fires the `on:create` event synchronously before its promise resolves, so the new note's graph node was already registered by the time the thread command ran its `BatchGraphUpdate`. The duplicate `AddNoteGraphUpdate` threw "There already exists a resolved node with the same name", aborting the batch and preventing the breadcrumb link from being written to the source note's metadata ([#696](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/696)).

### [4.11.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.11.0...4.11.1) (2026-05-20)

### Bug Fixes

* **Tree view always showed from root** — the Find Root toggle button (`FindRootButton`) was imported but never rendered in the Tree side-view toolbar, giving users no way to turn off the root-anchored behavior that a prior migration had enabled for everyone. The button is now present in the nav bar. A matching toggle and field-group selector are also exposed in Settings → Tree View so the preference is discoverable and configurable without opening the view ([#695](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/695)).

### [4.11.0](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.10.2...4.11.0) (2026-05-18)

### Features

* **Per-field Mermaid arrow style** — each edge field now has an optional arrow-shape dropdown in Settings → Edge Fields. Choose from `-->`, `---`, `==>`, `===`, `-.->`, `-.-`, `--o`, or `--x`. When set, that field's edges in Mermaid codeblock views render with the chosen arrow instead of the default. Edges with the same custom arrow on both directions collapse into a single bidirectional line (e.g. `==>`→`<==>`). ([#694](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/pull/694))

### [4.10.2](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.10.1...4.10.2) (2026-05-18)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix missing `version` field in `manifest.json`, which caused `"undefined"` to be recorded as the 4.10.1 version key in `versions.json`.

### [4.10.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.10.0...4.10.1) (2026-05-18)

### Chores

* Fix Obsidian community plugin validator warnings: remove `!important` from Banner-compat CSS rules (increase selector specificity with `:root` prefix instead), add trailing punctuation to plugin description, point `authorUrl` to author profile rather than plugin repo, replace deprecated `builtin-modules` package with Node's built-in `module.builtinModules`, and replace `npm-run-all` with the maintained `npm-run-all2` fork.

### [4.10.0](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.7...4.10.0) (2026-05-18)

### Features

* Add a search box to the Tree and Matrix side views, filtering displayed notes by title ([#691](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/pull/691)).

### Chores

* Enhance multi-parent display functionality ([#683](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/pull/683)).

### [4.9.7](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.6...4.9.7) (2026-05-16)

### Features

* Wire up the **Rebuild Graph → on note save** trigger. The setting had a toggle but no event handler, so enabling it did nothing. A `metadataCache` `changed` listener now rebuilds the graph when the toggle is on, debounced (~1.5s) via the existing `rebuildGraphDebounced` so rapid edits collapse into a single rebuild.

### Code Refactoring

* Differentiate edge-field errors from malformed-value errors. Added an `invalid_edge_field` error code distinct from `invalid_field_value`: the former flags a value naming an unregistered BC edge-field, the latter a malformed metadata value. Applied across the explicit edge builders (`dataview_note`, `dendron_note`, `folder_note`, `johnny_decimal_note`, `list_note`, `regex_note`, `tag_note`).

### Chores

* Remove a stale TODO in the `list_note` builder that was already answered by its own follow-up comment.

### [4.9.6](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.5...4.9.6) (2026-05-16)

### Chores

* Clear all 15 ESLint warnings (0 errors) so `bun run lint` passes under `--max-warnings=0`. Dropped redundant non-null assertions in the sibling-edge builders (`dendron_note`, `johnny_decimal_note`, `tag_note`), fixed import ordering in `main.ts`/`SettingsTab.ts`/`obsidian.ts`, and replaced an `app.plugins` `any` cast with a typed `AppWithPlugins` shim. No runtime behavior change.

### [4.9.5](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.4...4.9.5) (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix inline `.BC-page-views` rendering as a left column beside `.cm-sizer` (instead of stacking above it) when the Banners Reloaded plugin is **not** active on the current note. 4.9.4 removed `flex-wrap` from `.cm-scroller.BC-cm-scroller-inline-page-views`; default Obsidian uses `flex-direction: row`, so without wrap `.BC-page-views` became a flex sibling of `.cm-sizer`. Two follow-on issues blocked the wrap from taking effect:
  - `.banner-image` is injected as a scroller child by Banners Reloaded even when no banner is set on the note (no `.banner-view-active` class), consuming a flex column. The absolute-position rule on `.banner-image` is now ungated so it is always pulled out of flex flow.
  - The readable-line-width cap of 700px on `> .BC-page-views` applied in default Obsidian too, holding the trail at 700px inside a wide row so `.cm-sizer` still fit beside it. That cap is now scoped to `.banner-view-active` where it was intended.
  - `flex-wrap` is re-enabled on the scroller only when `.banner-view-active` is absent, so Banners Reloaded's column layout remains untouched.

### [4.9.4](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.3...4.9.4) (2026-05-13)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix inline page views (`.BC-page-views`) being pushed off-viewport when the Banners Reloaded plugin is active. Banners Reloaded flips `.cm-scroller` to `flex-direction: column` and applies negative horizontal margins to `.banner-wrapper`, which inflates `scrollWidth` and causes CodeMirror to assign an oversized inline width to `.cm-sizer`. Forced `.BC-page-views` to a full-width row so it stacks above `.cm-sizer` in either flex direction; when `.banner-view-active` is present, hide gutters, neutralize banner-wrapper negative margins, override CM's inline `cm-sizer` width, and absolute-position `.banner-image` so it doesn't push layout. With Obsidian's readable line width enabled, cap `cm-sizer` and unpinned `.BC-page-views` at 700px and center them.

### [4.9.3](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.2...4.9.3) (2026-05-12)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix Settings tab freezing Obsidian on Windows in 4.9.2 — the freeze had two stacked causes. (1) `reactive_settings.current` assigned to its own `$state` variable when read before init, which Svelte 5 detected as a derivation self-mutating its own dependency. (2) Three settings sub-components (`ShowAttributesSettingItem`, `EdgeSortIdSettingItem`, `FieldGroupLabelsSettingItem`) had a `$effect` that watched a `$bindable` prop and called `select_cb(value)` on every read; the callback writes back into `plugin.settings.X`, which re-notifies the same `$bindable` (Svelte 5 deep proxies fire on any property assignment, even with an identical reference), re-runs the effect, and so on until `effect_update_depth_exceeded` triggered after ~38s of awaited `saveData` calls. The store now initialises eagerly with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` and the three sub-components cache the previously-emitted value to skip self-triggered re-notifications.
* Add gated perf marks (`debug.level` set to `DEBUG`) around `SettingsTab.display`, each section mount, and reactive-loop counters around the suspect `$effect` bodies. Active only at `DEBUG` log level so default users see nothing.

### [4.9.3-beta.6](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.3-beta.5...4.9.3-beta.6) (2026-05-12)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix the Windows Settings-tab freeze (`effect_update_depth_exceeded` + ~38s click hang). Three settings sub-components — `ShowAttributesSettingItem`, `EdgeSortIdSettingItem`, `FieldGroupLabelsSettingItem` — had a `$effect` that watched a `$bindable` prop and invoked `select_cb(value)` on every read. The callback writes back into `plugin.settings.X`, which re-notifies the same `$bindable` prop (Svelte 5 deep proxies fire on any property assignment, even with an identical reference), re-runs the effect, and so on until Svelte's update-depth limit triggers. Each iteration awaits an async `saveData` disk write, which is why the hang stretched to ~38s. Each effect now caches the previously-emitted value and skips the callback when the prop reads back as the same reference, breaking the cycle.

### [4.9.3-beta.5](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.3-beta.4...4.9.3-beta.5) (2026-05-12)

### Diagnostics

* Rework `effect_counter` to track cumulative runs (no 250ms reset window) and log at thresholds 1/10/50/200/1000. Beta.4's window-based counter missed slow loops — the 38-second hang on Windows ran ~2 iterations/second, never hitting 50 in any 250ms window. Also extend coverage to remaining $effects in `TrailView.log`, `TrailView.depth`, `TreeView.depth`, `TreeView.root_open`, `LockViewButton`, `RenderMarkdown`.

### [4.9.3-beta.4](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.3-beta.3...4.9.3-beta.4) (2026-05-12)

### Diagnostics

* Extend reactive-loop counters to the four settings sub-components most likely to fire on tab open (`MatrixFieldOrderSettingItem`, `FieldGroupLabelsSettingItem`, `ShowAttributesSettingItem`, `EdgeSortIdSettingItem`) plus `ShowAttributesSelectorMenu.strip`. Beta.3 timings showed `SettingsTab.display` completed in 27ms but the `effect_update_depth_exceeded` error still fired on the next microtask, so the looping `$effect` lives in a sub-component that beta.3 did not instrument.

### [4.9.3-beta.3](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.3-beta.2...4.9.3-beta.3) (2026-05-12)

### Diagnostics

* Add gated perf marks and reactive-loop counters around the Settings tab (per-section timings, mount durations, `effect-storm` warnings on TrailView/Matrix/TreeView/TransitiveImpliedRelations/NestedEdgeList) to diagnose the remaining few-second Settings-open freeze on Windows. Active only when `debug.level` is set to `DEBUG`; no effect at default log level.

### [4.9.3-beta.2](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.2...4.9.3-beta.2) (2026-05-12)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix settings tab freezing Obsidian on Windows in 4.9.2 — the `reactive_settings.current` getter assigned to its own `$state` variable when read before init, which Svelte 5 detected as a derivation self-mutating its own dependency and looped to `effect_update_depth_exceeded`. The store now initialises `_settings` eagerly with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` so the getter is a pure read and `init()` simply swaps in the real settings.

### [4.9.2](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.1...4.9.2) (2026-05-12)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix [#686](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/issues/686) — opening the Breadcrumbs settings tab on some Android/Windows installs could freeze Obsidian's settings modal. The settings tab now wraps its render in a try/catch, logs the underlying error to the developer console, and shows a recoverable fallback UI with a "Reload settings" button instead of bricking the modal. Also serialised Svelte component teardown so `containerEl.empty()` no longer races pending `unmount()` promises, and `reactive_settings.current` falls back to defaults (with a warning) if read before init.

### [4.9.1](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/compare/4.9.0...4.9.1) (2026-05-11)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix view settings (trail enabled, prev/next enabled, matrix collapse) reverting on reload — settings written by TypeScript callbacks were lost because the Svelte 5 reactive proxy did not propagate plain-object mutations back to its internal signal sources. Converted `plugin.settings` to a getter/setter so all writes route through the proxy.
* Fix infinite reactive loop (`effect_update_depth_exceeded`) triggered when toggling trail or side view settings — `$effect` bodies in Matrix, TreeView, and TrailView were writing back to `plugin.settings` without `untrack()`, causing the proxy signal sources to re-trigger the same effects endlessly. Wrapped all proxy writes in `untrack()`.
* Fix `$effect.pre` in Matrix, TreeView, and TrailView re-running on every proxy write — the effects tracked proxy signal sources when reading `plugin.settings.views.*` to initialise local settings state, creating a feedback loop with the write-back `$effect`. Wrapped the snapshot call in `untrack()` so `$effect.pre` only re-runs when the `plugin` prop itself changes.
* Fix `lifecycle_double_unmount` error — concurrent `REDRAW_SIDE_VIEWS` events caused multiple `onOpen()` calls to race; both saw the same live component and both tried to unmount it. Debounced the event-driven `onOpen()` calls (100 ms trailing) so burst events collapse to a single remount.
* Fix Matrix and Tree side views remounting on every graph update or active-leaf change — debounced `REDRAW_SIDE_VIEWS` handler collapses rapid-fire workspace events into one remount per burst.
* Fix codeblock fatal-error log entries showing unexpandable `{…}` objects in the Obsidian developer console — errors are now logged as a formatted plain-text string with one line per error.
