# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

All commands use `bun` as the package manager.

```bash
# Development (watches TypeScript + CSS in parallel)
bun run dev

# Production build (type-checks, svelte-check, then bundles)
bun run build

# Run all tests (vitest)
bun run test

# Run a single test file
bun run test tests/settings/migration.test.ts

# Type-check only (no emit)
bun run tsc -noEmit -skipLibCheck

# Svelte type-check
bun run svelte-check

# Lint (ESLint + cargo clippy)
bun run lint

# Format (prettier + cargo fmt)
bun run fmt

# WASM — rebuild after any Rust changes
bun run wasm:build          # release
bun run wasm:dev            # debug (faster, larger)
bun run wasm:test           # Rust unit tests via wasm-pack
```

The build output is `main.js` and `styles.css` in the repo root. These are loaded directly by Obsidian from `.obsidian/plugins/breadcrumbs/`.

## Architecture

### Stack

- **TypeScript + Svelte 5** for all UI (runes syntax: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- **Rust/WebAssembly** (`wasm/`) for the graph engine — compiled with `wasm-pack`
- **Tailwind CSS** for styles
- **esbuild** bundles everything into a single `main.js`
- **Vitest** for unit tests (TypeScript only; WASM tests use `wasm-pack test`)

### The Graph Engine (WASM boundary)

The core graph lives in Rust (`wasm/src/`). TypeScript calls into it via the generated bindings in `wasm/pkg/breadcrumbs_graph_wasm.d.ts`. Key types:

- `NoteGraph` — the graph itself; holds nodes (vault files) and typed directed edges
- `TraversalOptions` — controls `rec_traverse_and_process()`: entry nodes, edge types to follow, max depth, and `separate_edges` (when `true`, each first-hop edge's subtree is restricted to that edge type; when `false`, all edge types are mixed)
- `FlatTraversalResult` / `FlatTraversalData` — the flattened traversal output consumed by `NestedEdgeList`
- `GCNodeData` / `GCEdgeData` — data transfer objects for building the graph from TS

The graph is a singleton on `plugin.graph`. It is rebuilt from scratch on `rebuild_graph()` (in `src/graph/builders/index.ts`) and updated incrementally via `BatchGraphUpdate` for file create/rename/delete events.

### Edge Building Pipeline

`rebuild_graph()` runs **9 explicit edge builders** in parallel, each returning `{ nodes, edges, errors }`:

| Builder | Source |
|---|---|
| `typed_link` | Frontmatter properties matching a field label |
| `tag_note` | Notes whose tag matches a BC-tag-note-tag field |
| `list_note` | Markdown list items treated as children |
| `dendron_note` | Dot/dash-delimited basename hierarchy |
| `johnny_decimal_note` | Numeric prefix hierarchy (e.g. `01.02 Title`) |
| `dataview_note` | Dataview query results |
| `date_note` | Sequential date-based notes |
| `folder_note` | Folder → note containment |
| `regex_note` | Regex matches on basenames |

After explicit edges are collected, `TransitiveGraphRule`s (stored in settings as `implied_relations.transitive`) are applied inside the WASM engine to generate implied edges (e.g. the `up`↔`down` pair).

Each explicit builder can read a per-note override from frontmatter via the `BC-*-field` metadata keys (see `src/const/metadata_fields.ts`). The fallback is `plugin.settings.explicit_edge_sources.<source>.default_field`.

### Settings

- **Shape** defined in `src/interfaces/settings.ts` (`BreadcrumbsSettings`)
- **Defaults** in `src/const/settings.ts` (`DEFAULT_SETTINGS`)
- **Migration** in `src/settings/migration.ts` — handles old v2/v3 settings shapes; runs on every load
- When adding a new settings field: add to the interface, add a default, and add it to every hardcoded `tree:` / `matrix:` object in `tests/settings/migration.test.ts`

### Views

**Side views** (Obsidian leaf panels):
- `TreeView` — recursive tree from active file; uses `rec_traverse_and_process`
- `Matrix` — shows incoming/outgoing edges grouped by field

**Page views** (rendered inside notes):
- `TrailView` — breadcrumb trail at top of note (grid or path format)
- `PrevNextView` — previous/next navigation buttons

**Codeblocks** (`src/codeblocks/`): ` ```breadcrumbs ``` ` blocks in notes, parsed by `CodeblockSchema` (zod), rendered as `CodeblockTree`, `CodeblockMermaid`, or `CodeblockMarkmap`

All Svelte side-view components hold a local `$state` copy of their slice of `plugin.settings` and write it back to `plugin.settings` via `$effect`. Settings panel changes (`src/settings/`) write directly to `plugin.settings` and call `plugin.refreshViews()`.

### `implied_pair_close_field`

Used by Dendron and Johnny.Decimal builders to automatically generate a reverse edge. If the `up` field has a single-step transitive rule with `close_field: "down"`, calling `implied_pair_close_field(settings, "up")` returns `"down"`, and the builder adds a `down` edge from parent → child alongside the explicit `up` edge from child → parent.
