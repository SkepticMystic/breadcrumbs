> [!IMPORTANT]
> Breadcrumbs has recently been rewritten from scratch, and is available in the V4 beta (downloadable via the Obsidian BRAT plugin). See here for more info on the changes: https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs/blob/master/V4.md

Breadcrumbs is an Obsidian plugin that lets you add _typed links_ to your notes, then view/traverse them in various ways. Internally, Breadcrumbs uses a graph to represent this structure (much like the regular Obsidian graph, except now, links have _types_ to them). You tell Breadcrumbs about the structure of your notes, then it lets you visualise and navigate the graph.

## Documentation

Breadcrumbs now has its own Obsidian Publish docs site!âœ¨ Going forward, that's where you can find all detailed documentation on the plugin. Check it out here: https://publish.obsidian.md/breadcrumbs-docs
