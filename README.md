Breadcrumbs is an Obsidian plugin that lets you add _typed links_ to your notes, then view/traverse them in various ways. Internally, Breadcrumbs uses a graph to represent this structure (much like the regular Obsidian graph, except now, links have _types_ to them). You tell Breadcrumbs about the structure of your notes, then it lets you visualise and navigate the graph.

## New Maintainer

As of May 2026, Breadcrumbs is maintained by [michaelpporter](https://github.com/michaelpporter). The plugin was originally created by [SkepticMystic](https://github.com/SkepticMystic), whose foundational work made this all possible. Development continues at [github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs).

## Obsidian 1.13

Breadcrumbs 4.13.0 is fully compatible with Obsidian 1.13. The settings tab uses the new declarative settings API — all sections appear in global settings search and support page-based navigation. The existing display() fallback remains for older Obsidian versions (minAppVersion stays 1.12.3).

## Demo Vault

Want to see Breadcrumbs in action before configuring your own vault? The [Breadcrumbs Demo Vault](https://github.com/michaelpporter/breadcrumbs-demo) is a ready-to-open vault with pre-configured edge fields, example notes, and working graph structure.

## Documentation

Breadcrumbs has its own docs site!✨ All detailed documentation lives there: https://breadcrumbs-docs.michaelpporter.com

Original creator SkepticMystic also accepts donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/skepticmystic) — their foundational work is what made this plugin possible.

## Security & Privacy

Breadcrumbs is fully open source. This section discloses every network request, binary module, and non-obvious code pattern in the compiled plugin.

### Network Requests

**Mermaid diagrams** — when you open a `breadcrumbs` codeblock rendered as Mermaid and click the **"View Image on mermaid.ink"** button, your browser opens `https://mermaid.ink/img/<encoded-diagram>` in a new tab. This is the only outbound network request. It is user-initiated (button click), not automatic. The diagram text is base64-encoded with `btoa()` and appended to the URL; no data is sent to any Breadcrumbs server.

No other network requests are made by this plugin.

### WebAssembly Module

The compiled bundle includes an inline WebAssembly binary. This is the **Breadcrumbs graph engine**, written in Rust and compiled with [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/). The full Rust source is in [`wasm/src/`](./wasm/src/) and can be audited directly. The WASM binary is never fetched from a remote URL; it is embedded at build time.

### wasm-bindgen Generated Code Patterns

`wasm-pack` generates JavaScript glue code in `wasm/pkg/breadcrumbs_graph_wasm.js`. Static scanners may flag three patterns in this generated file:

| Pattern | Origin | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fetch()` | wasm-bindgen shim | Fallback for loading WASM by URL. **Never called** — the plugin passes the inline binary directly to `init({ module_or_path: wasmbin })`. |
| `new Function(...)` | wasm-bindgen shim | Exposes `js_sys::Function` to Rust. Standard wasm-bindgen pattern; no arbitrary code is constructed from user input. |
| `wasm.memory` access | wasm-bindgen shim | JS reads/writes WASM linear memory to pass strings and arrays between Rust and JavaScript. Required by the WASM spec for cross-boundary data transfer. |

All of the above are generated automatically by wasm-bindgen and are not written by the plugin authors.

### Release process

#### Beta

1. Push all previous changes to the actual project
2. Bump version in `package.json` — the version must carry a `-beta.N` suffix
3. `bun run version:beta` to update `manifest.json` and `versions.json` accordingly
4. `git tag -a x.x.x-beta.N -m 'x.x.x-beta.N'` to tag the build
5. `git push origin x.x.x-beta` to push the release and trigger the action

Or, do steps 3-5 in one go with `bun run release:beta`

## History

Older media kept for posterity. Many predate v4 and may not match current behavior, but the effort of the authors is appreciated.
