 * versions (0.4 → 0.5) and can omit markdown notes the graph still needs, so
 * views like the tree could miss edges. Dataview remains used elsewhere (e.g.
 * `dataview-from` in codeblocks) via `dataview_plugin.get_api()`.
 *
 * `dataview` is always `null` here; optional `all_files.dataview?.forEach` in
 * builders remains a no-op. The old dual-source shape is not used for rebuild.
